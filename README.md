### About:
eduAssist.me is a mobile-friendly education webapp designed and developed by [Patrick Scheuchzer](https://github.com/patrick-scheuchzer), [Pascal Kress](https://github.com/wabi69sabi), [Pauline Gaget](https://github.com/lupiane), and [Spencer Bray](https://github.com/letired).  This app was built over a two-week sprint during the final weeks of the [Le Wagon](https://lewagon.com) Berlin bootcamp. As of May 2017, we have launched and are collecting user feedback.

### Goals:
* Mobile-first - our target audience doesn't have access to a desktop or laptop computer.  Most education software is designed for use on a large format screen with a keyboard and mouse, eduAssist is intended to be used on a handheld touchscreen device without a mouse or keyboard.
* Simple - no bloated features. Get started right away. Quick statistics on your student's performance without any prior configuration.
* Free - we wanted to build a piece of software that could help low-income teachers, not to make a profit.

### Contribute:
We'd love to collaborate with software developers of any skill level to help bring the best experience to our users.  Please don't hesitate to jump onboard!
