#eduAssist.me
is a mobile-friendly education webapp designed and developed by [Spencer Bray](https://github.com/letired), [Patrick Scheuchzer](https://github.com/patrick-scheuchzer), [Pascal Kress](https://github.com/wabi69sabi), and last but not least, [Pauline Gaget](https://github.com/lupiane).

Our goal for this project is to create a simple, easy-to-use piece of software that can aid teachers who don't have access to a desktop/laptop computer in basic classroom administration.
