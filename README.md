# eduAssist.me

eduAssist.me is a mobile-friendly education webapp designed and developed by [Patrick Scheuchzer](https://github.com/patrick-scheuchzer), [Pascal Kress](https://github.com/wabi69sabi), [Pauline Gaget](https://github.com/lupiane) and [Spencer Bray](https://github.com/letired).

Our goal for this project is to create a simple, easy-to-use piece of software that can aid teachers who don't have access to a desktop/laptop computer in basic classroom administration.
